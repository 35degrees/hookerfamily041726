/**
 * flight — the transitions for the single-subject re-focus morph
 * (DESIGN: "Page transitions" under MOTION LANGUAGE).
 *
 * The FEATURED CARD morphs as one element: `in:growFrom` flies it from the clicked box's
 * click-captured rect to center; `out:shrinkTo` flies the previous focus down into its new box.
 * Each RELATIVE box leaves via `out:flyOut` (a direct outro — no crossfade pairing, since nothing
 * `in:receive`s) which pins it out of flow at its true click-captured rect and fades it in the
 * navigation's pan direction; entering relatives gate on the card landing via `in:markPending`.
 * Click-time captures (origin rect, flight kind, clicked id, pan direction, rect snapshot) live at
 * the top of this file and are read by the transitions during the flush, then cleared one frame on.
